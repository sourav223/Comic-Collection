# Comic World
This project is an MVP of an XKCD comic viewer. Built with Swift and SwiftUI for iOS.
 
## Architect for the project
The project uses a simple MVVM-inspired structure

## Functionality so far in project
- UI & API for the home page.
- UI & logic for share comic


NOTE: 
- While going through the APIs found out there is no list of all the comics. It's only one comic at a time. I am going to add an API layer & remove the list. Load only one comic at a time in the page.
- Found out the heighest comic number 3156
